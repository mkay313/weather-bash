### How to run

##### python 3
Like above but run ./weather.py instead.

### About
Why look out of the window when you can check the weather on your computer without leaving the console?
This is a slightly modified version of a fun homework assignment for my studies at AMU Poznan.

Recently rewritten in Python 3 for exercise, because you never have enough in-console weather apps :)
