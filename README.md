### About
Why look out of the window when you can check the weather on your computer without leaving the console?
This is a slightly modified version of a fun homework assignment for my studies at AMU Poznan.
It uses the [apixu.com weather api](https://www.apixu.com) and [sunrise-sunset api](https://api.sunrise-sunset.org) to fetch data; add your apixu.com key with the -k flag when running the script for the first time.
